Providing new approach for creating, reading, updating and deleting files in a large, decentralized, network of servers or distributed systems. Some of the areas which were dealt include Security, managing cluster membership, byzantine attacks, Task scheduling, recovery and balancing, State consistency, searching objects.

Implemented Raft - distributed consensus algorithm to distribute a state machine across a cluster of computing systems using asynchronous messaging.

Developed on the top of core-netty framework, features including 
Leader election - Elect a leader that determines consensus between various nodes.
Log replication - Maintain multiple copies of log messages between internal nodes.
Transfer files - Transferring files using google protobuf between multiple clients

Technology Stack:
● Algorithm: Raft
● Server Side Coding: Java, Python
● Framework: Core Netty
● Message Passing: Google Protobuf
